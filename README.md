# Machine-learning-with-python
Practical Data Science with Python (RMIT 2022) assignment 2/3.

This project looks to model data using scikit-learn and python. Specifically, the project explores stack exchange data and looks to model how the labels
assigned to each post in the data set i.e. bayesian, probability, distributions etc can be predicted using a variety of features in the data set. One notable feature is text, the importance of words in predciting the label of a post is captured using TF-IDF or( Term Frequency(TF) â€” Inverse Dense Frequency(IDF). The project looks at both supervised (classification) and unsupervised (clustering) machine learning. 

Further details and how to start can be found within the "A2.pdf", further, the project is broken up into 4 sections which correspond to each notebook. These notebooks have more information relating to that section of the project.
